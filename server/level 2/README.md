# SERVER - Level 2

Using node and express, you have to create a small server with the following specifications:

- It can be started on `http://localhost:4000`.
- It is written in ES6/ES7 syntax using babel (babel-cli).
- It restarts itself on changes using nodemon.
- It has an endpoint called **wait** which waits a number of seconds before returning a result. This number is passed by url args: `http://localhost:4000/wait/:seg`. For example, `http://localhost:4000/wait/5` should wait for 5 seconds, then output *success*.
- The delay function used to wait must be created with a Promise.
- That promise must be consumed with a ES7 async/await function.

#### Extra tasks (welcomed, but not required)

- Deploy your server to production and give us an url (or just an IP). You can use Digital Ocean if you want. Use this link to get $10: [Digital Ocean](https://m.do.co/c/f355476b48bb).

#### Needed info

In order to use promises or async functions in express you need to wrap them with this function

```javascript
const wrap = fn => (...args) => fn(...args).catch(args[2]);
```

Then, simply do:

```javascript
app.get('/your-endpoint', wrap(async (req, res) => {
  const data = await getData();
}));
```
